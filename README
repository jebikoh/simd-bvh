# SIMD BVH

This is a separate repo to implement, test, and optimize SIMD accelerated BVH trees. It builds of the LBVH implementation in [JTX](https://github.com/jebikoh/JTX-PathTracer) (which is based off PBRTv4).

I am currently working on implementing a Quad-BVH (QBVH) from this paper: [Shallow Bounding Volume Hierarchies for Fast SIMD Ray Tracing of
